            "A hard link is a direct reference to the physical data on a disk, meaning multiple filenames can point to the same data. Deleting one hard link does not delete the data as long as another hard link exists. A soft link (or symbolic link) is a pointer to another file or directory. Deleting the original file breaks the soft link.",

Processes are isolated, whereas threads within the same process can communicate directly.",
